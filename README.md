1. If you don't already have Node installed on your computer follow instructions <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a> for downloading and installing it. This will allow you to use this package as well as tons of other kooool packages.



2. Once Node.js is installed, open the application called terminal. You can find terminal by opening a spotlight search (CMD + SPACEBAR) and typing in "terminal"




3. In the terminal window directly after the $ type the following line

   ```npm install -g undecided```
   
   then click ENTER
   
   > > _NOTE: if you get some errors that say something like npm ERR! Error: EACCES you can type in the following line:_
   
   > > ```sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local```
   
   > > then click ENTER and try `npm install -g undecided` again.
      
      
      **If you already have undecided.js installed on your system make sure you have the latest version by typing:**
      
      
      ```npm update -g undecided```
    
      

4. When the package has finished installing type the following line:

    ```undecided [number]```
    
      > > _NOTE: [number] represents the number of links you want to include on your website._
      > > For example, if you wanted to include 3 links on your website you would type:

      > > ```undecided 3```
    
    then click ENTER






 5. From here you can simply follow the prompts to fill out the names and urls for each of your links (clicking enter after each one). When typing in the name and the url be sure to separate them by a comma.
    For example:
     ```most boring website ever, http://google.com```
     
     
     

 6. After choosing the type of site you want and clicking enter you should receive a link in your terminal window. YAH0000! In addition to checking out your own url def checkout the <a href="https://desolate-scrubland-97851.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">undecided homepage</a> to see all links added by other undecided.js users.
