undecided.js is a TOOL for making webpages. By just typing one word (undecided) and one number (the amount of links you want to show) you can create a single webpage containing any and every link you can think of! You can link to your favorite website, or a PDF or your aunts website or an article worth reading...the internet is your oyster. in addition to receiving a url for your page all of your links will be posted to the undecided homepage where you can scroll through tons of other links posted by other undecided.js users.

These instructions are for Mac users - if you have questions please email me at undecidedsites@gmail.com

1. If you don't already have Node.JS installed on your computer you can install it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.

2. Once Node.JS is installed open the application called Terminal. You can find it easily by opening a spotlight search (CMD + SPACEBAR) and typing in "Terminal"

3. Directly after the $ write the following line:

   ```npm install -g undecided```

4. When the package has finished installing write the following line:

    ```undecided [number]```

    _NOTE: [number] represents the number of links you want to include on your website.
    For example, if you wanted to included 3 links on your website you would type:_

    ```undecided 3```

 5. From here you can simply follow the prompt to fill out the names and urls for each of your links. When typing in the name and the url be sure to separate them by a comma.
    Example:
     ```my favorite website, http://google.com```

 6. YAH0000! In addition to checking out your own url please go to the <a href="https://desolate-scrubland-97851.herokuapp.com/">undecided homepage</a> to see all the links ever added by undecided.js users.
