npm package for making a website

These instructions are for MAC users!

1. If you don't already have Node.JS installed on your computer you can install it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.

2. Once Node.JS is installed open the application called Terminal. You can find it easily by opening a spotlight search (CMD + SPACEBAR) and typing in "Terminal"

3. Directly after the $ write the following line:

   ```npm install -g undecided```
   
4. When the package has finished installing write the following line:

    ```undecided [number]```
    
    _NOTE: [number] represents the number of links you want to include on your website. 
    For example, if you wanted to included 3 links on your website you would type:_
 
    ```undecided 3```
    
 5. From here you can simply follow the prompt to fill out the names and urls for each of your links. When typing in the name and the url be sure to separate them by a comma.
    Example:
     ```my favorite website, http://google.com```
 
 6. VOILA! In addition to checking out your own url please go to the <a href="https://desolate-scrubland-97851.herokuapp.com/">undecided homepage</a> to see all the links ever added by undecided.js users.
